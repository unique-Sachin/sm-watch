# sm-watcher

sm-watcher is command-line tool that helps with the speedy development of Node. js applications.
It monitors your project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes.
This means that you do not have to stop and restart your applications in order for your changes to take effect.
It works same as nodemon but I have removed unwanted consoles that occurs in nodemon.

## How to use this?

### 1. Install the module first (npm i sm-watcher).

### 2. Go to package.json file.

### 3. add "scripts": {"start": "sm-watcher index.js"} in package.json file.

### 4. run "npm start" and enjoy your work hassel free.

## If you do not want to install every time there is another way to setup only once in your system and free for always. All the steps you can find in readme file of repo of this module on github.
