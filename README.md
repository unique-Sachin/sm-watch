# sm-watch
sm-watch is  command-line tool that helps with the speedy development of Node. js applications. 
It monitors your project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes. 
This means that you do not have to stop and restart your applications in order for your changes to take effect.
It works same as nodemon but I have removed unwanted consoles that occurs in nodemon.
